# 7th Sea Second Edition System (Unofficial)

## Roleplaying System
[7th Sea](https://www.chaosium.com/7th-sea/) is a tabletop roleplaying game of swashbuckling and intrigue, exploration and adventure, taking place on the continent of Théah, a land of magic and mystery inspired by our own Europe.

Players take on the roles of heroes thrown into global conspiracies and sinister plots, exploring ancient ruins of a race long vanished and protecting the rightful kings and queens of Théah from murderous villains. It is a world of sharp blades and sharp wits, where a cutting retort can be just as deadly as a sword’s point.

## Status
The project is in its infancy. I will try to only update the code as I have a version that is usable. I won't update the version from 0.0.1 until I feel like the project is in a usable state. I am currently learning and designing the system and the forms. This is a part time project for me when I am not doing my full time work, running games, or working on maps for my patrons.

What is done:
1. Character sheet with basic character information and traits and skills.
2. Advantages sheet ready for use
3. Basics pop up for skill rolling from a skill.

## Rough Road Map
I don't have a timeline for when I think this will be usable for games, gut estimate is a 3-4 months. The things that I need to add to get this to a usable place, probably in priority order, are:
1. Validate with Chaosium that I am creating the module in a way that meets the Fan Material Policy
2. Skill rolling with raise calculation
3. Displaying skill rolls in chat based on 7th sea's raises not total rolls
4. If allowed under Fan material policy add nation selection
5. If allowed under Fan material policy add trait selection from nation selection
6. Working stories tab in the character sheet
7. Backgrounds sheet design
8. Character sheet support for drag and drop backgrounds and advantages
9. Automate addition of advantages from backgrounds
10. Automate skill additions based on backgrounds
11. Sorcery sheet design
12. Sorcery tab design on character sheet
13. Drag and drop sorcery features to character sheet
14. Limit maximum value of traits and skills to 5
