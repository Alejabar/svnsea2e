# 7th Sea Second Edition System (Unofficial)

## Roleplaying System
[7th Sea](https://www.chaosium.com/7th-sea/) is a tabletop roleplaying game of swashbuckling and intrigue, exploration and adventure, taking place on the continent of Théah, a land of magic and mystery inspired by our own Europe.

Players take on the roles of heroes thrown into global conspiracies and sinister plots, exploring ancient ruins of a race long vanished and protecting the rightful kings and queens of Théah from murderous villains. It is a world of sharp blades and sharp wits, where a cutting retort can be just as deadly as a sword’s point.

## Usage

Because 7th Sea Second Edition doesn't have an SRD or anything other than the quick start the system lacks compendiums. GMs will need to create all of the advantages, backgrounds and other items they want to use for character creation.

### Item Creation

I designed backgrounds to allow you to select existing advantages to associate with the background. When a background is dragged to a character (player, hero, or villain) all associated advantages are looked up and copied to the character. All skills selected with the background are also increased by 1. If a background is removed then the system attempts to remove the associated advantages and decrease all skills associated with the background by 1.

I recommend taking the time and adding as many advantages as you have in you books before creating backgrounds. When associating advantages to backgrounds I use the advantages name to look up its id. The id to the global advantage is what is stored. If an advantage is deleted and recreated the background will need to be modified before being assigned to the character. If a background has already been assigned it may not deleted

All other item types are independent of each other. Advantages can also be added separately without backgrounds.

Stories are easier to create via the character sheet rather than created as an item and dragged and dropped to the character sheet. Stories tend to be specific to the character and individual not generic.

### Character Creation

Character creation is mostly manual, except when adding backgrounds. Selecting a nation DOES NOT add a point to a trait, this has to be done manually.

### Starting a game

Once you have created items and going through character creation I recommend also creating one danger dice actor to keep track of the danger dice the GM has.

## Project Status
The project has reached a usable state for games, but is still in a beta phase. I am looking for feedback and recommendations for improvements.

### Rough Road Map


These are nice to have items that could make the system more automated:
1. Add trait selection from nation selection
